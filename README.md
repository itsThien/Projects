# Project Showcase: "ML Concepts", "Portfolio", and "JobScraper"

This repository contains three distinct projects:

1.  **ML Concepts**: An interactive guide to core machine learning concepts.
2.  **Portfolio**: A personal portfolio website for a full-stack developer.
3.  **JobScraper**: A Python script for scraping job postings.

## Running the Projects

The "ML Concepts" and "Portfolio" projects are self-contained static HTML files. To view them, simply open the `ML Concepts` or `Portfolio` file in your web browser.

The "JobScraper" project is a Python script. To run it, you will need to have Python installed, set the necessary environment variables for API keys, and then execute the script from your terminal.

## Project Details

### ML Concepts

This project is an educational tool designed to explain fundamental machine learning concepts in an interactive and visually appealing way. Key features include:

*   **Interactive Charts**: Visualizations for data partitioning and model fitting (underfitting, good fit, overfitting).
*   **Concept Explanations**: Clear descriptions of data partitioning, model fitting, classification vs. regression, and evaluation metrics.
*   **Metric Calculator**: An interactive tool to calculate accuracy, recall, and precision from a confusion matrix.
*   **Dark Mode**: A theme toggle for comfortable viewing in different lighting conditions.

The file for this project is `ML Concepts`.

### Portfolio

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website for a full-stack developer named Thien Nguyen. It showcases their skills, projects, and contact information. Key features include:

*   **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
*   **Smooth Scrolling & Animations**: Engaging user experience with smooth scrolling and subtle animations.
*   **Featured Projects**: A section to highlight key projects with links to live versions.
*   **Contact Form**: An integrated contact form for inquiries.
*   **Dark Mode**: A theme toggle for user preference.

The file for this project is `Portfolio`.

### JobScraper

This project is a Python script that scrapes job postings from the web using the Google Custom Search API. It extracts job details, cleans the data, and saves the results to a JSON file. Key features include:

*   **Google Custom Search**: Uses the Google API to find job listings based on a search query.
*   **HTML Parsing**: Extracts job descriptions, company names, and locations from the raw HTML of job posting pages.
*   **Data Cleaning**: Cleans and formats the extracted data to be more readable and useful.
*   **JSON Output**: Saves the cleaned job data to a JSON file for easy use in other applications.
